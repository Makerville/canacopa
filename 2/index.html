  <h4> Hot Reloading Game Engine </h4>
  <h5>Abstract</h5>
  <p> Due to the advent of Internet,everything now has two personae: one physical,one
digital.digital one consists of profiles which are photographs,likes,dislikes and favourites.
But these personae are not always connected to each other. For instance, places around us
have so many services to offer, but we tend to ignore them all the time. Technologies
(GPS/AGPS) and providers(Google Maps, OpenStreetMaps etc) have done massive
profiling of outdoor locations and places, and provide a rich experience to users, but the same cannot be said of indoor locations. We rely on boards, signs and other people to get
relevant information inside a building. But what if buildings could themselves provide
services that are available to the user and give contextual notifications, which would enhance
user experience inside any building? We have built a generic system which uses Eddystone
beacon technology to augment physical experiences, in any location. </h4>
